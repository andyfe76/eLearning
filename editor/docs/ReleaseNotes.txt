SPAW Editor PHP Edition
version 1.0.2
Release Notes

Thanks to everyone who downloaded, tried and supported SPAW Editor!

This release adds "active toolbar" feature (toolbar reflecting style
and functions applicable to current selection). This feature is 
sponsored by "MALING intelligent computing", http://www.maling.de. 
Also HTML code editing is now performed in a standard textarea.

IMPORTANT: Changes mentioned above may (and most likelty do) require you
to make changes to custom toolbar files you made. As of this release
each toolbar file can have each toolbar item only once. You will most
likely only have to remove "top_html" array from your toolbar file.

Check out ChangeLog.txt for the list of new features and bugfixes.


Many people asked about instructions on integrating SPAW Editor into
various content management systems. We don't have experience with many CMSs
and no time to dig. So it would be nice if you could share your experience with
others if you integrate SPAW into some publicly available CMS. Send your
instructions or links to pages with instructions to spaw@solmetra.com

Also if you are fluent in any of languages that are now included and 
see any typos or mistakes please report to spaw@solmetra.com

Happy editing,
