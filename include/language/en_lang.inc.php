<?php

// This file contains the "language" for the K-Lore feedback system
// SEE: en_defs.inc.php for the variable definitions associated with this language.
// FEEDBACK TYPES:
// Errors, Help, Warnings, Feedback, and Info
// FUNCTIONS INCLUDE: print_feedback($feedback),print_help($help), print_popup_help($help),
//  print_infos($infos), print_warnings($warnings)
//
// Feedback can be added using the 5 feedback functions,
//
// -using Text messaged: print_feedback("This is simple text feedback");
//   **this method is not recommended as it makes it more difficult to translate K-Lore
//
// -using an array of messages: print_errors($errors); - where $errors is defined
//  as an array variable $errors[]=AT_ERROR_SIMPLE_EXAMPLE1; $errors[]=AT_ERROR_SIMPLE_EXAMPLE2; ...
//  multiple messages of the same type are grouped together and displayed in a single feedback box.
//
// -using a second array with search and replace characters
//   (e.g. $errors[]=array(AT_ERROR_SIMPLE_EXAMPLE, "some text", $a_variable)
//   the second and third arguments would replace the %1 and %2 strings. )
