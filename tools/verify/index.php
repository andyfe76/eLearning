This script will produce a list of all functions required by Terracotta 0.6 to run
on your server and will let you know if you can get around it by changing settings
in the configuration file. This script does not depend on the libraires provided by
the Terracotta project and is thus not available in multiple languages. <i>We also
recommend that you delete this script once you have successfully installed the product
on your server.</i><br/><br/>
